Did you know you can use in-line R code even in the YAML content? Take a look at the `date:` entry. What I've written there is in-line R code to grab today's date from your computer using `Sys.time()` and then formatted it to display as day-month-year. This is a way of automatically updating the date based on when you knit the .Rmd file! You can modify this a bunch of ways - see [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/update-date.html) for more details!
