# 1. Getting Organized

Download and edit [this template](`r url_template`) when working through this assignment. Notice that this week's template is a .Rmd file.

# 2. Readings

At this point in the class, we know how to design conjoint surveys, field them on formr.org, clean the resulting data, estimate models, and assess the uncertainty around the resulting coefficients. But what do those coefficients actually mean? How should we use them to gain design insights?

This week, we'll begin considering these questions as we learn how to use estimated model coefficients to compute estimates of "willingness to pay" (WTP) and make predictions about how likely people would be to choose each option in a set of alternatives. **Take notes** as you watch the video on these topics, and answer the practice questions in the video as part of your reflection. You may submit your answers however you wish, e.g. hand-write them on paper and take a picture and / or type answers in your reflection .Rmd file.

# 3. Reflect, Knit, & Submit

Reflect on what you've learned and any questions or points of confusion you have about WTP and market simulations. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing? After reflecting, do the following:

- Write a few sentences in the template you downloaded for this assignment.
- Click the "knit" button to compile your .Rmd file into a html web page.
- Open up the resulting html file in your web browser and see how it looks!
- Create a zip file of everything in your R Project folder and submit the zip file in the "Assignment Submission" page on Blackboard.
