## Practice Questions 1

Suppose we estimate the following utility model describing preferences for cars:

$$
\tilde{u}_j = \alpha p_j + \beta_1 x_j^{\mathrm{mpg}} + \beta_2 x_j^{\mathrm{elec}} + \varepsilon_j
$$

where the variables are

- $p_j$: Price in USD $1,000
- $x_j^{\mathrm{mpg}}$: Fuel economy in miles per gallon
- $x_j^{\mathrm{elec}}$: Variable that takes 1 if the car is an electric car and 0 otherwise

The estimated model produces the following coefficients:

- $\alpha$: -0.7
- $\beta_1$: 0.1
- $\beta_2$: -4.0

a) Use the estimated coefficients to compute the WTP for fuel economy and electric car vehicle type.

```{r}
# Write code here
```

b) Use the estimated coefficients to compute market shares for the alternatives in the following market:

<div style="width:200px">
alternative | price | mpg | elec
1 | 15 | 20 | 0
2 | 30 | 100 | 1
3 | 20 | 40 | 0
</div>

```{r}
# Write code here
```

Very few people will choose the electric vehicle (option 2). Most will choose the less expensive (and less fuel efficient) gasoline vehicle.




## Practice Questions 2

Suppose we estimate the following utility model describing preferences for cars:

$$
\tilde{u}_j = \alpha p_j + \beta_1 x_j^{\mathrm{mpg}} + \beta_2 x_j^{\mathrm{elec}} + \varepsilon_j
$$

where the variables are

- $p_j$: Price in USD $1,000
- $x_j^{\mathrm{mpg}}$: Fuel economy in miles per gallon
- $x_j^{\mathrm{elec}}$: Variable that takes 1 if the car is an electric car and 0 otherwise

The estimated model produces the following coefficients and hessian:

- $\alpha$: -0.7
- $\beta_1$: 0.1
- $\beta_2$: -4.0

$$
\nabla_{\beta}^2 \ln(\mathcal{L}) =
\begin{bmatrix}
-6000 & 50 & 60
\\
50 & -700 & 50
\\
60 & 50 & -300
\end{bmatrix}
$$

a) Generate 10,000 draws of the model coefficients using the estimated coefficients and hessian. Use the `mvrnorm()` function from the `MASS` library.

```{r}
# Write code here
```

b) Use the draws to compute the mean WTP and 95% confidence intervals of WTP for fuel economy and electric car vehicle type.

```{r}
# Write code here
```
