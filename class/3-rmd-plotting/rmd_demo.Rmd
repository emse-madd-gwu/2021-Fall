# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see [rmarkdown.rstudio.com](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

# In-line code 

In-line code allows you to insert R code directly into a sentence. For example, the sum of 3 and 4 is `r 3 + 4`. Here the value of 7 was computed from `3 + 4` and inserted into the sentence. 

You can also use variables. For example, the `bears` data frame has `r nrow(bears)` rows.

# Code chunks 

Code chunks are places to write longer bits of R code that will be compiled. For example, let's say I wanted to show the first 6 rows of the `bears` data frame - I could write that in a chunk like this: 

```{r}
head(bears)
```

Now when compiled, the print out of `head(bears)` will show.

You can change how the chunk behave by changing some settings inside the `{r}` part of the chunk. For example, if I only want to show the result of the code (and not the code itself), I can set `echo=FALSE`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(bears)
```

If I only want to show the code but not actually run it, I can set `eval=FALSE`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(bears)
```

If I want to the code in the background but not show anything, I can set `include=FALSE`:

```{r, include=FALSE}
head(bears)
```

# Plots

## Using ggplot

Here is an example of how to make a plot with ggplot2:

```{r}
bears %>%
  count(month) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = as.factor(month), y = n)) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 22) + 
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Count")
```

## Inserting an image file 

You can define the side using `out.width`, like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="20%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/madd_hex_sticker.png")
```
