This course requires prior exposure to:

- Probability theory
- Multivariable calculus
- Linear algebra
- Regression

Each of these concepts will be applied throughout the course, and no time will be spent reviewing the foundational elements of each concept.

In addition, we will work in the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) throughout the course, but no prior programming experience is required. We will spend the first three weeks going through exercises to get up to speed in R.
