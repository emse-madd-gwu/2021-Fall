This page has everything you need to do to prepare for class. Ideally, you should do all these things _before_ the first day of class.

First, register for the following:

- [Slack](https://emse-madd-s22.slack.com): a link to sign up for the course slack page can be found on the only announcement on Blackboard.
- Install the Slack app on your phone and **Turn notifications on!**
- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/home): **you must use your @gwu.edu email for this to work** (not the @email.gwu.edu address). An invite link can be found in the announcement on Blackboard or in Slack.

Next, install R and RStudio:

- [Download and install R](https://cloud.r-project.org).
- [Download and install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (Desktop version).

**We will always work in RStudio**, so be careful to open RStudio and not the default R application that comes with R.

In other words:

<div style="width:200px">
Open this   | Not this
:----------:|:----------:
![](images/RStudio-Ball.png){ width=50 }  |  ![](images/Rlogo.png){ width=50 }
</div>

# Course prerequisites

```{r child = '_prerequisites.Rmd'}
```
