The exam for this class is a take home exam. You will be sent exam instructions after class on December 1, and you must submit your response on Blackboard by midnight on December 5.

Rules:

- You must work **on your own** for this exam - you may not work with, ask questions, or otherwise collaborate with anyone else on the exam.
- The exam is open note, meaning you can use any of the course materials we have used throughout the semester.
